## How To Use
Please build it with Visual Studio or [download](https://github.com/okanon/JsonParseViewer/releases) the Windows binary and use it. There is a possibility that it does not operate normally under Windows 7 or below. It requires [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-Us/download/details.aspx?id=49981) to run.


Since binary files are integrated with dynamic libraries, binary files can be executed by themselves.

## Build

Please copy [MetroRadiance](https://github.com/okanon/MetroRadiance) to __JsonParseViewer/source/MetroRadiance__ so that it has the same directory structure and build it. 
Otherwise MetroRadiance.dll will not have errors at build time.

__Because we are using the `RichTextBox` feature, please use [MetroRadiance](https://github.com/okanon/MetroRadiance) that I forked instead of [Mr. Grabacr07](https://github.com/Grabacr07) MetroRadiance__
